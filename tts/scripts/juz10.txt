Assalamu Alaikum, and welcome to our summary of Tafsir Ibn Katheer, covering Juz 10.
This Juz spans from verse 41 of Surah Al-An-FAAL, through to verse 92 of Surah Ah-Tau-bah. Together, these passages cover the aftermath of the Battle of Badr, the bonds of the early Muslim community, and the Prophet's campaigns during the ninth year of Hijrah. They form a comprehensive guide to Islamic law, warfare, and the exposure of hypocrisy within the Muslim community.

The Battle of Badr and Divine Victory
The Juz opens by reflecting on one of Islam's most significant early battles. Allah establishes that one-fifth of all war gains belong to Him and His Messenger, peace be upon him, with the remaining four-fifths distributed among the fighters. This ruling is presented as a matter of faith. Even withholding the smallest item is considered a serious matter.
The Battle of Badr itself is referred to as "Yawm Al-Furqaan," meaning the Day of Criterion, where Allah distinguished truth from falsehood through miraculous intervention. Despite being outnumbered, the believers were supported by angels. Allah caused the disbelievers to perceive the Muslim forces as doubled in number, and the Prophet, peace be upon him, threw sand toward the enemy's faces as a sign of divine aid. These interventions carry a central lesson: victory depends on Allah's support and the believers' steadfastness, not on numerical superiority.

Building Community Through Brotherhood
A major theme throughout this Juz is the transformation of human relationships through Islam. The Muhaajireen, the emigrants from Makkah, and the Ansaar, the helpers of Madeenah, were granted mutual inheritance rights and established as close allies. This special bond, which was later replaced by the fixed inheritance shares for blood relatives, demonstrates Islam's ability to unite former enemies into one cohesive community.
The Juz emphasizes that the believers' loyalty to one another must come before all other ties. When faith and family come into conflict, faith must take priority.

Warfare, Justice, and Moral Integrity
The Juz provides detailed guidance on the conduct of warfare and the treatment of captives. When prisoners were taken at Badr, including Al-Abbaas ibn Abdul-Muttalib, a debate arose over how they should be treated. Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, advocated for leniency through ransom, and the Prophet, peace be upon him, accepted this position.
Remarkably, verse 70 of Surah Al-An-FAAL promised those captives who later embraced Islam that they would be compensated with more than what was taken from them. This promise was fulfilled when Al-Abbaas later received wealth far exceeding his earlier losses.
Even in warfare, Islamic law demands moral integrity. If the enemy inclines toward peace, the Muslims are required to do the same. And individual non-Muslims who seek safe passage must be granted protection so they may hear the message of Islam. This reflects the religion's deep commitment to peaceful invitation.

Sacred Boundaries and Religious Purity
Surah Ah-Tau-bah opens uniquely, without the traditional Bismillah, announcing a declaration of freedom from obligations toward those who associate partners with Allah. The Prophet, peace be upon him, issued clear proclamations: after the ninth year of Hijrah, no polytheist could perform the Hadj pilgrimage, and no one could perform Tawaaf unclothed.
Verse 28 of Surah Ah-Tau-bah establishes that those who associate partners with Allah are considered spiritually impure and are therefore prohibited from approaching Al-Masjid Al-Haraam. Believers, by contrast, are recognized as inherently pure. This reflects Islam's firm insistence on the sanctity of monotheistic worship.

Exposing Hypocrisy
Perhaps the most distinctive feature of this Juz is its extensive exposure of hypocrisy. Surah Ah-Tau-bah is sometimes called "Al-Faadihah," meaning the Exposer, because it reveals the hidden intentions and lies of the hypocrites despite their false oaths.
These individuals questioned the Prophet's integrity in distributing charity. They broke promises they had made to Allah. Some even attempted assassination. The text documents specific incidents, including plots during the campaign of Tabook, showing that hypocrisy represents a fundamental breach of covenant with Allah. Three signs characterize the hypocrite: lying when they speak, breaking their promises, and betraying trust.

Practical Guidance and Spiritual Lessons
The Juz also provides essential rulings, including the eight categories of those eligible to receive Zakaat. These are: the poor, the needy, those who collect and distribute it, those whose hearts are being inclined toward Islam, slaves seeking their freedom, those burdened by debt, those striving in the cause of Allah, and travelers in need.
It also establishes that legitimate excuses, such as blindness, physical disability, or illness, exempt individuals from participating in Jihaad without any blame. However, those who are able-bodied yet refuse to participate face serious consequences. The Juz repeatedly reminds us that good deeds must be grounded in sincere faith. Worship without true monotheism holds no value.

The Overarching Message
Juz 10 presents Islam as a complete system addressing every dimension of life, from military conduct to inheritance law, from the treatment of enemies to the detection of internal deception.
Its central message is this: victory, whether on the battlefield or in the spiritual sense, comes through unwavering faith in Allah, obedience to His commands, moral integrity even during conflict, and an absolute rejection of hypocrisy.
The Juz calls upon the believers to place their covenant with Allah above all worldly concerns. It assures them that those who sacrifice for His cause will be rewarded far beyond their losses, while those who betray their covenants will face a severe and lasting consequence.
Through the narratives of Badr, Hunayn, and Tabook, alongside detailed legal rulings, this Juz makes clear that the Muslim community thrives when its members maintain sincere faith, mutual loyalty, and an unwavering commitment to the path of Allah.
Jazaak Allahu Khayran for listening, and may Allah grant us all understanding and sincerity.
