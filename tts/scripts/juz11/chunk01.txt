Assalamu Alaykum, and welcome to our journey through Juz Eleven of the Noble Quran. This passage draws from three powerful surahs: Surah towbah, Surah Yoo-nus, and Surah Hood. Together, these verses weave a tapestry of faith, accountability, and divine justice, themes that cut to the very heart of what it means to believe.
