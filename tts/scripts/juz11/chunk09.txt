Ka'b ibn Malik described it: the earth, vast as it is, felt narrow and constricted around him. His own soul suffocated him. There was nowhere to turn except to Allaah. And then, divine revelation descended. Allaah announced their forgiveness. SubhaanAllaah. The lesson is staggering in its clarity. Truthfulness, even when it hurts, even when it means admitting your own failure, leads to salvation. While convenient lies lead only to destruction.
