Zakah and Purification The juz then turns to Zakah, obligatory charity, and reminds us that it is not merely a tax. It is purification. Purification of the soul. Purification of wealth. When you give for the sake of Allaah, you are not losing something. You are cleansing yourself of attachment to this world.
