The Prophet's supplication for donors brings mercy. Allaah accepts repentance and charity from clean hearts, while He destroys usury. When Abu Bakr became Khaleefah after the Prophet's passing, some tribes refused to pay Zakah. And Abu Bakr, may Allaah be pleased with him, fought them. Not out of greed, but out of principle: this obligation does not die with the Prophet. It belongs to the institution of Islam itself.
