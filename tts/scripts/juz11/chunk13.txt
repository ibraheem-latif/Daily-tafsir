A transaction. Affirmed not just in the Quran, but in the Torah and the Gospel. And who is more faithful to their promise than Allaah? Those who honor this covenant repent, worship, praise, fast, bow, prostrate, command what is right, forbid what is wrong, and observe Allaah's limits. So rejoice, oh believers, for this is the supreme success.
