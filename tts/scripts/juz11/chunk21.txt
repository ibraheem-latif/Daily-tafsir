Because the awliyaa, the friends of Allaah, those who believe and maintain taqwah, they experience no fear regarding future horrors and no grief over what this world has taken from them. Their glad tidings come in this life, through righteous dreams, through the peace in their hearts, through the good that others speak of them. And in the Hereafter, through the angels' welcome and the gardens of Paradise.
