Only Allaah has the right to declare what is lawful and what is forbidden. The polytheists of Arabia had invented their own religious laws, arbitrary prohibitions, baseless rituals, rules with no divine authority. And Allaah condemns this in the strongest terms. To make laws without Allaah's permission is to fabricate lies against Him.
